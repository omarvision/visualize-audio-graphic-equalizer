# visualize-audio-graphic-equalizer
Visualize Audio Data by splitting the sample data playback into frequency ranges and changing the height of some cubes.  Use AudioSource.GetSpectrumData...  I think this method is being deprecated but I have this video ready now, I'll make another with the more recent function to call later.
